## [Project1 - Profitable App Profiles for the Google Play Market](https://github.com/Fiza-Iftikhar/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/Project1-Profitable%20App)
   - As data analysts for a company that builds Android mobile apps, Our aim in this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for Google Play markets. 
   - At our company, we only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use our app. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.
- [A data set](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps/home) containing data about approximately ten thousand Android apps from Google Play.
- Clean the duplicate data from the dataset based on max reviews.

### Conclusion
   - From the above analysis we conclude that, the most installed app categories are Communication, vedio players and social apps. And these app categories have a big competitor like whatsapp, Youtube, Facebook and instagram etc. So, to decide which app we should develop we should further do an analysis according to the business requirments. Or we should discuss with the top management as they know what kind of app will be possible for them to develop according to the needs of their business requriment and decision also rely on the budget constraints.



## [Project2 - Exploring Hacker News Posts](https://github.com/Fiza-Iftikhar/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/Project2-Hacker%20News)
- In this project, we'll work with a data set of submissions to popular technology site [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). Hacker News is a site where user-submitted stories (known as `"posts"`) are voted and commented upon.
   - We're specifically interested in posts whose titles begin with either **Ask HN** or **Show HN**. Users submit `Ask HN` posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question
   - Likewise, users submit `Show HN` posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.
   - We'll compare these two types of posts (i.e Ask HN posts and Show HN Posts) to determine the following:

        1. Do `Ask HN` or `Show HN` receive more comments on average?

            ![Comparision of posts comments](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70064467/122598764-1f729300-d022-11eb-8787-7f416f20bbf2.png)

        2. Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?

### Conclusion:
 - From above graph we conclude that, the best time to recevie more comments on **Ask_HN posts** is **15:00 PM** and the best time to recevie more comments on **Show_HN** is **18:00 PM**. So, if you really wanna recevie more comments on Ask_HN and Show_HN posts on hacker news, than you should posts on those time period.

- We'll be working with a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. The original data on job outcomes was released by [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/), which conducts surveys and aggregates the data.
